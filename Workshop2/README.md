# Workshop 2: XXX

## Friday, April 28 (10am-1pm)

Instructor: Phred Benham (phbenham@gmail.com)

This workshop is designed to provide a brief introduction into some commonly used approaches to identifying outlier genes of interest that may be under selection or associated with a phenotype of interest. Methods discussed will include genome scans and statistical approaches for making associations between genotype data and environmental or phenotypic variation. In the second half of the workshop, we will discuss approaches to demographic analysis (e.g. gene flow, Ne fluctuations, divergence time) in population genomics datasets. The workshop will provide an overview of how to make demographic inferences using the site frequency spectrum.

### Topics

**1. Genome scans to detect loci under selection. (slides [here](XXX))**
* ***Use vcftools to perform and interpret commonly used selection scan techniques between two populations (e.g. Fst, Dxy, Tajima's D,    Nucleotide diversity). 
* ***Learn how to make Manhattan plots to visualize results.
* ***Use bedtools and other software to identify specific outlier genes. 
* ***Activities and questions [here](XXX)***

**2. Genotype-environment association methods (slides [here](XXX))**
* ***Activities and questions [here](XXX)***

**3. Site frequency spectrum (and basic demography) (slides [here](XXX))**
* ***Activities and questions [here](XXX)***

### Software required
**Online:** [http://geneontology.org](http://geneontology.org/)

**Linux:** `vcftools`, `bedtools`, `GADMA`

**R packages:** `RDA`, `GEMMA`, `qqman`

See course installation instructions [here](XXX).

### Example dataset to be used

We will be using rangewide exome sequence data of the Savannah Sparrow (*Passerculus sandwichensis*), which contains XX SNPs for XX individuals. We will also be subsetting this dataset to perform selection scans between groupings of individuals depending on habitat.
