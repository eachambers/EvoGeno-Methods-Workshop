# ========================================================================================

# ================================= 1. RUNNING ADMIXTURE =================================

# Admixture takes in a bed file, which you should have created using plink. We're going to
# run it on both our LD-pruned and un-pruned datasets just to see how the results compare.
# Sometimes, chromosome names aren't supported by admixture, and this is the case with the
# Lampropeltis data. The problem is with the bim file, which is the file that accompanies
# a bed file. The first column of the bim file needs to be the chromosome code, which must
# be 'X'/'Y'/'XY'/'MT'; '0' indicates unknown. If you take a look at the bim files that were
# made by Plink in exercise 1, you'll notice that the first column has RAD tag numbers. The
# easiest way to get around this is to replace all of these RAD tag numbers with 0s. To do
# so, run the following on **BOTH** your pruned and unpruned bim files:

$ awk '{$1=0;print $0}' file.bim > file.bim.tmp # adds zeros to first column
$ mv file.bim.tmp file.bim # replaces original bim file

#		(1a) Run admixture with K=3 for both the pruned and unpruned bed files.
#				*** YOUR ANSWER HERE ***

# Admixture generates two files for each run: a Q file containing the ancestry fractions, 
# and a P file containing the allele frequencies of the inferred ancestral populations. 

# ====================== 2. DATA VISUALIZATION OF SUMMARY STATISTICS =====================

# The following exercise uses the R script Workshop1_Exercise2.R.

#		(2a) Using the missing data stats you generated in step 1.3a, plot the data however you 
#			 would like. What is the average proportion of missing data across the entire
#			 dataset?
#				*** YOUR ANSWER HERE ***

#		(2b) Using the depth statistics you generated in step 1.3b, plot the data in whichever 
#			 way you would like. What is the average read depth across the entire dataset?
#				*** YOUR ANSWER HERE ***

#		(2c) Is there a relationship between missing data and read depth?  If these 
# 			 were your data, would you remove some samples to minimize low coverage and/or
#			 high missing data? 
#				*** YOUR ANSWER HERE ***

#		(2d) Using the PCA results generated in 1.4d, generate a scatterplot for the first
#			 two PC axes (*hint:* use the plink.eigenvec file).
#				*** YOUR ANSWER HERE ***

#		(2e) How much variation is explained by PCs 1 and 2? See R script for skeleton
# 			 code to calculate this.
#				*** YOUR ANSWER HERE ***

#		(2f) Is there a relationship between the fixation index (F) and PC1? *hint:*
#			 this is the F column from the .het plink file.
#				*** YOUR ANSWER HERE ***

#		(2g) Using skeleton code provided in the R script, generate a visualization of the
#			 the admixture results for the LD-pruned dataset (using the Q files).
#			 BONUS: Generate a PCA for the LD-pruned dataset. How does it differ from that 
#			 of the unpruned dataset?
#				*** YOUR ANSWER HERE ***

#		(2h) Based on what you've observed about the data from all your visualizations, 
# 			 what do you notice about the major groupings within the PCA (axes 1 and 2)? 
#			 Are the groupings along PC1 explained by (a) read depth, (b) missing data, or 
#			 (c) a different species having been included in the dataset? What is your 
#			 evidence for this? Are there other reasons that could explain the pattern 
#			 and how would you investigate these?
#				*** YOUR ANSWER HERE ***
