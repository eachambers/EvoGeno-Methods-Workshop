### GENERATING THE LAMPROPELTIS DATA FILE

# There was some additional processing required to generate the Lampropeltis vcf file to
# make it a little easier to deal with (and to more closely mimic vcfs typical of WGS
# datasets).

# The vcf was downloaded from Dryad here: 

#		1. Compressed the vcf to vcf.gz:
$ bgzip -c lampro_n93_noMD.vcf > lampro_n93_noMD.vcf.gz

#		2. Indexed the vcf (no contigs were defined in header of vcf):
$ bcftools index lampro_n93_noMD.vcf.gz # could also do tabix -p vcf lampro_n93_noMD.vcf.gz

#		3. Generate a vcf that has the contigs defined in header:
$ bcftools view -O v -o lampro.vcf lampro_n93_noMD.vcf.gz
