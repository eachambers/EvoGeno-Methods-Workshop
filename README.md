# EvoGeno-Methods-Workshop

In this course, we'll be exploring common analyses of genome-scale datasets, beginning with data exploration ([Workshop 1](https://github.com/eachambers/EvoGeno-Methods-Workshop/tree/main/Workshop1)), through to data analysis ([Workshop 2](https://github.com/eachambers/EvoGeno-Methods-Workshop/tree/main/Workshop2)), and ending with comparative genomics and phylogenomics ([Workshop 3](https://github.com/eachambers/EvoGeno-Methods-Workshop/tree/main/Workshop3)). Each workshop will be a three-hour-long session which will include both lectures and worksheets.

**Instructors:**

Yocelyn Guti√©rrez-Guerrero (ygutierrezgro@berkeley.edu)

Phred Benham (phbenham@gmail.com)

Anne Chambers (eachambers@berkeley.edu)

### Time and location

The workshops will be held at the **Evans computer lab (room B3A) from 10AM to 1PM on Friday April 21, April 28, and May 5**.

### Installation information

This workshop requires pre-installation of various softwares and R packages. Find detailed instructions on which software you'll require for the workshop, and installation instructions, [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J-HjigOT_Zeu1xv38uY6dttdloo8OQG2km_fr87qIMk/edit?usp=sharing).

### Miscellaneous

**Office hours:** Valeria (vramirezc@berkeley.edu) will be holding online office hours on **April 7 and April 14 from 10AM-12PM** to help with software installation or any other questions that you may have before the workshop. Please sign up for an appointment [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/selfsched?sstoken=UUhMMnB0S2NKYW9LfGRlZmF1bHR8NjFjMjMzMGE1MzJhNTY3YWI0M2ZkYzE1OWE5ZjQ1Y2M).

**Devices & software:** Personal computers are preferred, but if your computer collapses easily when working with multiple software at a time, you can always use the computers that are available in the room. You can also use your Savio account but this is not mandatory or necessary in most cases. 

**Additional optional workshops to attend:** The D-lab at UC Berkeley is a great resource for getting additional resources in data science. If you have no previous experience, we would highly recommend attending the [R basics workshop](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/events/r-fundamentals-parts-1-4/2023-03-27) (April 5) before attending the EvoGenomics Methods workshop. Other D-lab workshops are available [here](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/training/upcoming-workshops).

**Accommodations & access:** Although the workshop is not hybrid, we will be recording lectures and all the resources, presentations, and pipelines are available on this GitHub repository.
